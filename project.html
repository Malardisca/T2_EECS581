            <h4>  Stock  analyzer  </h4>
            <h2>  Project  Synopsis  </h2>
            <h4>  An  application  that  let  people  buy  stock  with  it.  Provide  recognized  stock  pools,  help  people  to  make  decisions,  and  provide  value  information.</h4>  
            <h2>  Project  Description </h2> 
            <h2>  •	Why  is  the  project  being  undertaken?  </h2>
            <h4>  This  project  is  being  undertaken  to  improve  the  benefit  of  individual  investors.  Because  many  people  want  to  try  stocks,  but  not  everyone  is  an  economist,  and  majority  companies  or  cooperation  can  hire  specialties  to  spend  tons  of  time  investigating,   training,  and  simulating  the  trading  on  databases,  cloud,  paid  platforms.  The  advantages  of  individual  investors  are  being  suppressed.  There  are  many  kinds  of  stocks  in  the  stock  exchange  market,  and  most  people  cannot  find  the  information  they  need  quickly  and  effectively.  So,  it  is  critical  to  create  software to  help  them  filter  out  some  good  value  stocks.  In  our  project,  we  try  to  create  a  software  to  analyze  the  stock  market  and  provide  some  effective  information  about  stocks.  
            </h4>
            <h2>Describe  an  opportunity  or  problem  that  the  project  is  to  address.  </h2>
            <h4>Stock  trading  is  very  complex  and  requires  the  analysis  of  various  data.  Therefore,  in  order  to  obtain  the  suitest  stratege,  it  is  necessary  to  use  big  data  to  obtain  and  analyze  information  from  various  websites,  which  is  a  huge  challenge  for  undergraduates  to  implement  web  data  crawlers.  It  also  involves  money,  so  the  safety  aspect  is  very  important.  We  might  also  need  to  simulate  the  trading  before  we  actually  use  it,  so  to  build  a  simulator  can  also  be  a  potential  problem.  </h4>
            <h2>What  will  be  the  end  result  of  the  project?  </h2>
            <h4>It  will  be  an  application  called  Automated  Stock  Trading  System.  Help  people  analyze  the  rise  and  fall  of  stocks  and  provide  real-time  information.  Analyze  and  provide  effective  stocks.  When  the  stock  fluctuates  sharply,  it  can  remind  people  to  reduce  losses  in  time.  </h4>

            <h1>Preliminary  Project  Design  </h1>
            <h2>How  the  software  works  </h2>
            <h4>Auto  Earn  will  be  a  stock  market  auto  trade  tool  that  is  primarily  aimed  at  adults  and  elder  who  have  interest  in  the  stock  market  and  have  money  to  invest.  During  our  research,  we  found  that  most  of  the  companies  use  programming  to  analyse  the  market  and  create  some  strategy  to  help  them  trade,  and  online  trading  and  analysis  systems  are  broadly  used  in  the  financial  area.  Generally  speaking,  our  program  will  help  individuals  who  don’t  have  the  knowledge  and  resources  on  the  stock  area  to  invest  simpler.  The  software  will  be  a  local  application  that  needs  to  download  and  input  information  into  it,  and  it  will  output  the  suggested  stocks  to  buy.  </h4>
            <h4>The  basic  organization  of  the  software  is  that  it  obtains  users  input  screening  strategy,  including  a  company’s  financial  and  fundamental  analysis  and  applies  it  to  a  certain  history/  market  in  order  to  calculate  the  same  strategy’s  probability  of  earning  and  losing.  First  enter  the  software,  the  user  will  see  the  create  account  and  password  or  login  option  like  every  social  account  does.  Then  the  user  will  be  able  to  select  the  location  of  the  market,  like  America,  Europe  or  Canada,  then  select  the  more  specific  market  like  New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  Nasdaq.  After  selecting  the  location,  there  are  several  additional  features  that  are  available  to  select,  like  industry  or  sector,  but  the  user  can  also  skip  the  part.  After  fulfilling  the  pre-request  information,  the  user  can  now  select  several  different  analyses  to  screen  the  pools  from  several  aspects,  including  
                Popular,  Ratios,  Price,  Volume  &  Volatility,  Fundamental,  Dividends  and  Technical  Indicators.  
                </h4>
            <h4>For  each  main  criteria,  the  user  will  have  further  selection,  for  example:  Price->Last,  
                DailyChange%,  52wk  Range-High/low,  1yr  Change,  etc.  The  software  will  list  all  of  the  stocks  that've  been  screened  and  the  user  can  remove  stocks  that  don’t  meet  the  requirements.  After  that,  the  user  will  be  able  to  save  the  strategy  and  to  apply  it  to  other  locations  or  sectors.  The  next  step  is  to  apply  the  strategy  in  certain  history,  location  or  industry  to  check  whether  the  earn/lost  ratio  and  expected  value  is  profitable.  </h4>
            <h4>The  software  will  provide  the  expected  value,  probability  etc  and  generate  an  outcome  about  the  strategy.  The  software  will  simulate  the  strategy  in  history  and  check  the  amount  of  spend  and  amount  of  reward.  One  of  the  possibilities  of  the  project  is  to  try  every  single  strategy  and  find  the  best  one,  but  it  requires  tremendous  storage  and  calculation  so  we  need  to  find  the  best  way  to  approach.  The  last  step  is  to  provide  needed  suggestions  for  the  user  to  apply  the  outcome  to  the  real  world  data.  User  will  need  to  provide  their  account  and  password  so  that  the  system  can  access  the  saved  strategy  and  auto  trade  filtered  stocks  by  user’s  willingness,  the  user  will  being  notified  every  time  when  the  system  is  operating  the  account  to  buy  or  sell,  and  the  user  will  also  know  the  amount  of  earned  and  the  time  of  stocks  being  holded,  in  history.   </h4>

            <h2>Maching,  Pricing  &  Market  Intergrity  </h2>
            <h4>According  to  different  matching  algorithms,  the  simplest  matching  logic  is  actually  easy  to  understand.  The  buy  and  sell  orders  are  arranged  in  two  lists  according  to  the  price.  The  bid  price  (BID)  is  from  the  high  to  the  bottom  (the  higher  the  bid,  the  easier  the  transaction),  and  the  sell  The  price  (ASK)  from  low  to  high  (the  lower  the  selling  price,  the  easier  it  is  to  trade).  </h4>
            <h2>Order  Entry  </h2>
            <h4>The  price  from  the  matching  system  is  what  we  say  daily,  and  there  are  five  levels  of  data,  historical  data,  K-line  integration,  etc.,  which  is  another  module  that  is  responsible  for  the  aggregation,  sorting  and  broadcasting  of  prices.  </h4>
            <h2>Risk  Control  </h2>
            <h4>The  place  responsible  for  receiving  your  buying  and  selling  orders  needs  to  do  a  risk  check  before  sending  it  to  the  matching  engine,  such  as  whether  the  funds  are  sufficient,  whether  it  is  on  the  blacklist,  whether  the  account  is  locked,  and  so  on.  </h4>
            <h2>Front-end  </h2>
            <h4>Where  the  user  may  come  into  contact,  control  user  entry,  user  session  management,  enter  order,  cancel,  query  order  information,  view  account  holding  ratio  and  other  information.  </h4>
            <h2>Clearing  </h2>
            <h4>The  process  of  classifying  and  summarizing  transaction  data  based  on  institutions  and  transaction  types,  and  calculating  the  settlement  amount.  </h4>
            <h2>Design  Constraints</h2>
            <h2>  Technical  Constraints </h2> 
            <h4>Security/High  Availability</h4>  
            <h4>For  the  financial  system,  this  is  a  rigid  indicator.  Security  may  be  divided  into  different  categories.  For  example,  the  internal  environment  of  the  enterprise.  The  financial  system  generally  has  its  own  proprietary  network  environment.  There  are  also  very  strict  controls  on  the  office  work  behavior.  After  all,  the  fortresses  are  often  from  Internal  breaches.  
                Most  of  the  parts  related  to  our  transactions  are  data  and  platform  security,  platform  security,  information  exchange  channel  security,  platform  stability,  data  storage  security,  tamper-proof,  and  redundant  backup  to  prevent  loss.  Thus,  Regarding  security  issues,  we  are  currently  not  very  confident.  
                </h4>
            <h2>Business  Constraints  </h2>
            <h4>Timetable:  This  project  was  proposed  by  Yaoqian  Mai,  and  then  we  received  his  recruitment  and  joined  in.  The  concept  of  this  project  was  put  forward  in  August  2021.  We  met  with  the  professor  and  introduced  our  ideas.  After  the  introduction,  we  started  to  make  a  plan.  Our  plan  starts  in  September  2021.  After  the  start  of  the  plan,  we  will  report  on  tasks  every  week  to  ensure  that  everything  can  be  completed  on  time.  </h4>
            <h4>Team  composition  and  composition:  Each  member  of  our  team  has  their  own  good  parts,  and  appropriate  tasks  are  assigned  according  to  each  person's  strengths.  For  the  weak,  we  will  help  to  ensure  that  everyone  can  contribute  to  the  group.  Enabling  everyone  to  participate.  </h4>
            <h2>Ethical  Issues  </h2>
            <h4>For  stock  trading,  some  ethical  issues  revolve  around  getting  clients  to  make  appropriate  investments,  and  these  investments  may  not  bring  as  much  income  to  advisors.  This  obviously  violates  the  traditional  moral  concept.  For  example,  this  issue  extends  to  investment.  Putting  customers  into  the  right  investment  portfolio  means  evaluating  and  sticking  to  the  customer’s  risk  tolerance  and  time  frame.  Older  clients  should  generally  not  own  90%  of  growth  stocks,  even  if  he  insists  on  doing  so.  Even  if  an  investment  is  appropriate  in  terms  of  risk,  ethical  issues  also  involve  costs.  Perhaps  there  is  a  S&P  500  index  foundation  that  pays  a  certain  fee  to  the  broker  and  sells  it  to  clients.  At  the  same  time,  there  are  several  S&P  500  no-load  funds  and  low-cost  ETFs  that  will  provide  customers  with  the  same  market  exposure  at  a  lower  cost,  even  if  it  means  that  advisors  are  paid  much  less.  The  needs  of  customers  must  be  put  first.  </h4>
            <h4>So  for  our  stock  trading  software,  there  is  no  such  same  problem.  Because  our  stock  trading  software  mainly  analyzes  the  market  trend  for  customers,  and  obtains  detailed  data  from various  websites  to  provide  them  to  customers.  So  as  to  give  customers  some  basic  concepts.  These  are  just  to  help  customers  understand  the  stock  from  the  side.  </h4>
            <h4>Some  stocks  are  not  recommended  for  clients,  and  these  investments  may  not  bring  so  much  income  to  the  consultant.  The  most  important  thing  is  that  we  set  up  an  emergency  reminder  mode,  if  there  is  a  large  fluctuation  in  the  stock,  it  will  immediately  alert  the  customer.  These  are  all  in  order  to  be  able  to  give  customers  a  better  personal  experience.  </h4>
            <h2>Intellectual  Property  Issues  </h2>
            <h4>The  program  code  of  computer  software  can  be  protected  by  means  of  application  software  development  rights.  So  as  to  protect  our  due  ability.  The  graphical  user  interface  of  computer  software  can  be  protected  by  applying  for  a  design  patent.  On  the  other  hand,  because  our  code  also  borrowed  some  open  source  code.  We  will  mark  where  the  open  source  code  was  obtained.  Creating  source  code  is  a  creative  process,  which  means  that  the  results  of  such  works  can  be  protected  by  copyright  law,  because  the  code  can  be  treated  as  an  original  work  by  the  author.  At  the  same  time,  creating  code  involves  hundreds  of  relatively  small  tasks.  These  tasks  are  repetitive,  but  not  unique.  Therefore,  they  are  not  protected  by  copyright.  This  is  indisputable.  We  will  carefully  screen  some  of  the  open  source  code  borrowed  from  our  software  to  ensure  the  legitimacy  of  the  code.  </h4>
            <h4>Regarding  the  images  and  designs  in  our  software,  they  may  conflict  with  other  people's  products.  We  will  avoid  conflicts  and  balance  their  development.  Then  our  products  should  create  due  value  in  society  and  create  benefits  for  the  public.  On  the  other  hand,  we  may  also  conflict  with  other  people's  products  on  the  name  of  the  software.  If  there  is  a  conflict,  it  is  very  difficult  for  us  to  register.  </h4>
            <h2>Change  Log  </h2>
            <h4>Changed  --Why  is  the  project  being  undertaken?   </h4>
            <h4>We  have  made  new  changes  to  our  project  plan  and  understanding  of  the  project,  because  as  our  project  continues,  we  also  have  a  new  understanding  of  our  project.</h4>
            <h4>   Changed--Project  Milestone  </h4>
            <h4>In  the  continuous  progress  of  the  project,  due  to  various  factors,  we  have  changed  the  original  time.  These  are  all  adjustments  made  in  order  to  be  able  to  make  reasonable  adjustments  to  the  project.  </h4>
